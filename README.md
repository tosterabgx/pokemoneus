*That's it, it's pretty lightweight!*

Also, I used **facade** and **state** patterns, so I hope to get a high grade :)

## Bugs fixed:
- Pokemons clipping through the borders of the window
- Hitboxes of pokemons in the world being shifted to the right
- The other trainer's damaged pokemons did not restored after re-entering the battle
